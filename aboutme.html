			<p><span class="bub">Bub</span> is a very special, one of a kind critter.</p>
			<p>More specifically, she is the most amazing <span class="cat">cat</span> on the planet. Discovered as the runt of a healthy feral litter in a tool shed in rural Indiana, she was taken in as a rescue when it was clear that she would require special care. Since then, <span class="bub">Bub</span> has overcome great challenges, is a published author, a talk show host, a movie star, and has helped raise well over $100,000 for animals in need.</p>
